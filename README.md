# CryptoClustering-Gish
Module 19 challenge assignment


All code for this assingment is found in the Crypto_Clusetering_code file.

All code is my own except for the final part where I compile the graphs in order to compare the elbow data and plots respectively. I was no sure how to do this so I found the solution code through chat GPT. I originally had not saved these plots in variables so I had to go back and add that to the code.
